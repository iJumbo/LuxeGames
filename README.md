LuxeGames v0.1
=========

Team project for developers on the Luxe Minecraft Server!

I know this is the first project with all the developers together, however this will be a good opportunity
for each of you to get a 'feel' for eachother.


The goals of this plugin are as followed -

- A fully automated and working hunger-games plugin. If possible linked with the hub in a way that you type /games when it is ready to start. Once at least 20 players type /games everyone will be teleported to a set place on the map (Most likely using Varide's maps).

- The players inventories would have to be saved/restored when the game starts and ends.

- A prize of 200 economy awarded to the winner of each game.

- Scheduled games to run every hour.

If anyone has ideas they may have, please don't hesitate to share them!

Thanks, and be sure to check back for updates!
